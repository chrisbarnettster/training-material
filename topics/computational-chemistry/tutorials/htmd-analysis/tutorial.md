# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

This tutorial provides an introduction to using high-throughput molecular dynamics to study protein-ligand interaction, as applied to N-terminus of Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90). 


<!-- This is a comment. -->

<!-- General introduction about the topic and then an introduction of the
tutorial (the questions and the objectives). It is nice also to have a
scheme to sum up the pipeline used during the tutorial. The idea is to
give to trainees insight into the content of the tutorial and the (theoretical
and technical) key concepts they will learn.

You may want to cite some publications; this can be done by adding citations to the
bibliography file (`tutorial.bib` file next to your `tutorial.md` file). These citations
must be in bibtex format. If you have the DOI for the paper you wish to cite, you can
get the corresponding bibtex entry using [doi2bib.org](https://doi2bib.org).

With the example you will find in the `tutorial.bib` file, you can add a citation to
this article here in your tutorial like this:
{% raw %} `{% cite Batut2018 %}`{% endraw %}.
This will be rendered like this: {% cite Batut2018 %}, and links to a
[bibliography section](#bibliography) which will automatically be created at the end of the
tutorial. -->

# Background

## What is high-throughput molecular dynamics?
Molecular dynamics (MD) is a method to simulate molecular motion by iterative application of Newtonâ€™s laws of motion. It is often applied to large biomolecules such as proteins or nucleic acids. A common application is to assess the interaction between these macromolecules and a number of small molecules (e.g. potential drug candidates). This tutorial provides a guide to setting up and running a high-throughput workflow for screening multiple small molecules, using the open-source GROMACS tools provided through the Galaxy platform.


## Why is Hsp90 interesting to study?
The 90 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) is a chaperone protein responsible for catalyzing the conversion of a wide variety of proteins to a functional form; examples of the Hsp90 clientele, which totals several hundred proteins, include nuclear steroid hormone receptors and protein kinases. The mechanism by which Hsp90 acts varies between clients, as does the client binding site; the process is dependent on post-translational modifications of Hsp90 and the identity of co-chaperones which bind and regulate the conformational cycle.

Due to its vital biochemical role as a chaperone protein involved in facilitating the folding of many client proteins, Hsp90 is an attractive pharmaceutical target. In particular, as protein folding is a potential bottleneck to slow cellular reproduction and growth, blocking Hsp90 function using inhibitors which bind tightly to the ATP binding site could assist in treating cancer; for example, the antibiotic geldanamycin and its analogs are under investigation as possible anti-tumor agents.

# Simulation

## Topology generation

Now we have downloaded a PDB structure of the protein we wish to study, we will start parameterizing it for MD simulation.

GROMACS distinguishes between constant and dynamic attributes of the atoms in the system. The constant attributes (e.g. atom charges, bonds connecting atoms) are listed in the topology (TOP file), while dynamic attributes (attributes that can change during a simulation, e.g. atom position, velocities and forces) are stored in structure (PDB or GRO) and trajectory (XTC and TRR) files.

The PDB file we start from only explicitly states atom type and position. Therefore, before beginning simulation, we need to calculate the rest of the information contained within the topology file. There are a range of force fields which perform these calculations in slightly different ways.

Parameterization needs to be done separately for the ligand and protein. Therefore, the first step is to separate the PDB file into two sets of coordinates - one for the ligand and one for the protein.

> ### {% icon question %} Question
>
> 1. Why do protein and ligand need to be parameterized separately?
>
> > ### {% icon solution %} Solution
> >
> > 1. Protein and small molecules are constructed differently. A protein is made up of 20 different building blocks (amino acids) - therefore, to construct a protein topology, amino acid topologies simply need to be combined appropriately. By contrast, the structure of small molecules is far more flexible and needs to be calculated for each different structure.

### Extract protein and ligand coordinates

{: .hands_on}


### Set up protein topology

Firstly, we need to calculate the topology for the protein file. We will use the **GROMACS initial setup** {% icon tool %} tool.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Task description
>
> 1. **GROMACS initial setup** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - *"PDB input file"*: 'Protein (PDB)' file
>    - *"Force field"*: `gaff`
>    - *"Water model"*: `TIP3P`
>    - *"Generate detailed log"*: `Yes`
>
>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment
>    >
>    > Comment here about choice of force field, water model
>    {: .comment}
>
{: .hands_on}

The tool produces four outputs: a GRO file (containing the coordinates of the protein), a TOP file (containing other information, including on charges, masses, bonds and angles), an ITP file (which will be used to restrain the protein position in the equilibration step later on), and a log for the tool.

Please note all GROMACS tools output a log. Generally, you only need to look at this when a job fails. It provides useful information for debugging if we encounter any problems.


### Generate a topology for the ligand

To generate a topology for the ligand, we will use the **acpype** {% icon tool %} tool. This provides a convenient interface to the AmberTools suite and allows us to easily create the ligand topology in the format required by GROMACS.

## Solvation and energy minimization

Having generated topologies, we now need to combine them, define the box which contains the system, add solvent and ions, and perform an energy minimization step.

### Combine topology and GRO files

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Combine GRO files
>
> 1. On the `Structure file (GRO format)` created by the **acpype** tool,click on the `Visualize this data` icon. Select `Editor` to open the file using the text editor integrated into Galaxy. Select all the lines starting with `1 GSE` and copy your selection.
> 2. Open the Protein GRO file by clicking on the `Visualize this data` button on the dataset.
> 3. Paste the lines from the ligand GRO file just before the last line.
> 4. If you scroll back to the top, you will see that the total number of atoms in the system is given in the second line (`3280`). You have just added 21 new atoms, so increase the value by 21 to `3301`.
> 5. Click `Export` to save your changes as a new dataset. Make sure the datatype of the new file is still `GRO`. Rename to `System GRO file`.
{: .hands_on}

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Combine topology files
>
> 1. On the ligand `Topology` created by the **acpype** tool, right-click on the `Visualize this data` icon and open the link in a new tab. Select the first section in the file, starting with `[ atomtypes ]`, and copy the selection. 
> 2. Returning to the first tab, open the protein TOP file using the text editor integrated into Galaxy by clicking on the `Visualize this data` button on the dataset. 
> 3. Paste the lines from the ligand ITP file near to the top of the file, just after the line `#include "amber99sb.ff/forcefield.itp"`.
> 4. Go back to the ligand ITP file and select the rest of the file (from `[ moleculetypes ]`) onwards. Copy the selection.
> 5. In the protein TOP file, paste the selection near to the bottom of the file, before the line `; Include water topology` (and just after the position restraint file). Notice that the `[ moleculetype ]` section you just copied starts with `base` - this is the name acpype has given to the ligand. Feel free to change this to whatever you prefer - `ligand`, or `GSE`.
> 6. Finally, we need to state in the topology that we have included a new kind of molecule. Go to the final section (`[ molecules ]`) and add a new line `base` (or whatever name you gave the ligand in step 5), with a 1 in the `#mols` column.
> 5. Click `Export` to save your changes as a new dataset. Make sure the datatype of the new file is still `TOP`. Rename to `System topology`.
{: .hands_on}

If this procedure was too complicated, you can download the combined files here: LINK. However, you will find it useful to understand the information contained within topology files and learn how to make changes to it.

### Create the simulation box with **GROMACS structure configuration**

The next step, once combined coordinate (GRO) and topology (TOP) files have been created, is to create a simulation box in which the system is situated.

> ### {% icon hands_on %} Hands-on: Task description
>
> 1. **GROMACS structure configuration** {% icon tool %} with the following parameters:
>    - {% icon param-file %} *"Input structure"*: `System GRO file` (Input dataset)
>    - *"Configure box?"*: `Yes`
>        - *"Box dimensions in nanometers"*: `1.0`
>        - *"Box type"*: `Triclinic`
>    - *"Generate detailed log"*: `Yes`
>
>
>    > ### {% icon comment %} Comment
>    >
>    > This tool simply adds a box of the required dimensions to the GRO file. A distance of at least 1.0 nm is recommended to avoid interactions between the protein and its mirror image. On the other hand, increasing the box size too far will increase the simulation time, due to the greater number of solvent molecules which need to be treated.

>
{: .hands_on}

### Solvation

The next step is solvation of the newly created simulation box. Note that the system is charged (depending on the pH) - the solvation tool also adds sodium or chloride ions as required to neutralise this.

>    - {% icon param-file %} *"System topology"*: `output`
>    - *"Generate detailed log"*: `Yes`
>
>
{: .hands_on}


### Energy minimization

The next step is energy minimization, which can be carried out using the **GROMACS energy minimization** {% icon tool %} tool.

>    - Rename output to `Minimized GRO file`
>
{: .hands_on}


## Equilibration

We now carry out equilibration in two stages: NVT and NPT. This is discussed at greater length in the basic GROMACS tutorial. Equilibration requires restraining the protein structure - we use the ITP file produced by the initial setup tool for this.

> ### {% icon comment %} More detail about equilibration
>
> At this point equilibration of the solvent around the solute (i.e. the protein) is necessary. This is performed in two stages: equilibration under an NVT ensemble, followed by an NPT ensemble. Use of the NVT ensemble entails maintaining constant **n**umber of particles, **v**olume and **t**emperature, while the NPT ensemble maintains constant **n**umber of particles, **p**ressure and **t**emperature. (The NVT ensemble is also known as the isothermal-isochoric ensemble, while the NPT ensemble is also known as the isothermal-isobaric ensemble).
> 
> For equilibration, the protein must be held in place while the solvent is allowed to move freely around it. This is achieved using the position restraint file we created in system setup. When we specify this restraint, protein movement is not totally forbidden, but is energetically punished.

Having stabilized the temperature of the system with NVT equilibration, we also need to stabilize the pressure of the system. We therefore equilibrate again using the NPT (constant number of particles, pressure, temperature) ensemble.

Note that we can continue where the last simulation left off (with new parameters) by using the checkpoint (CPT) file saved at the end of the NVT simulation.

## Main simulation

We can now remove the restraints and continue with the simulation. The simulation will run for 1 million steps, with a step size of 1 fs, so wil have a total length of 1 ns.
